;; This module is a Linear congruential psudeo random number generator.
;;
;; It uses the following algorithm
;;
;; 	Seed = (A * SEED +C) MOD M
;;
;; NOTES: A must be a multiplier of 4 plus one
;;        C should be psudeoprime (or at least odd)
;;
;;
;; To generate a random number between 1 and ?
;; RndNum = {Seed+2} MOD ? + 1
;;
;; In order to increase the observed randomness of this module,
;; the function `AddJoypadEntropy` should be called once every frame.
;; This will cycle the random number generator once or twice, depending
;; on the state of JOY1.

	;; Adds entropy to the random seed by calling `Rnd`
	;;	* twice if the state of JOY1 has changed since the last call.
	;;	* once if the joypad hasn't changed.
	;;
	;; This can add a bit of variety to the random number generator.
