;; Represents the metasprite frames objects.
;;
;; In order to simplify processing of the metasprite frame, there are no
;; signed integers in both frame/object data structures.
;;
;; This format is designed upon the following assumptions:
;;
;;	* Each entity/frame uses only a single palette which is already
;;	  preloaded into CGRAM by the animation subsystem.
;;
;;	* The animation subsystem can allocate one or two blocks of VRAM for
;;	  each entity.
;;
;;	  By having the entity allocate one or two blocks of VRAM we prevent
;;	  fragmentation when allocating VRAM tiles for entities that need
;;	  64 tiles and 32 tiles together.
;;
;;	  To further improve VRAM allocation there are two sizes of blocks:
;;
;;		* a single 16x16 tile.
;;		* two 8x8 rows of tiles.
;;
;;	  This allows for entities with the following allocations:
;;
;;		* A single 16x16 tile
;;		* Two 16x16 tiles
;;		* Two VRAM rows (8 16x16 tiles)
;;		* Four VRAM rows. (This option should only used for bosses)
;;
;;
;;
;; The OAM properties of the sprites is calculated by:
;;	oam.xpos = entity.xPos - 128 + frameObject.xPos
;;	oam.ypos = entity.yPos - 128 + frameObject.yPos
;;	oam.size = frameObject.attr & 1
;;	if frameObject.char & 0x20 == 0:
;;		oam.charAttr = (frameObject.charAttr & 0xF01F) + entity.blockOneCharAttrOffset
;;	else:
;;		oam.charAttr = (frameObject.charAttr & 0xF01F) + entity.blockTwoCharAttrOffset
